# Club Champion - Nikodem Wolnik
27th July 2022

Congratulations to our new Club Champion - Nikodem Wolnik. In a year which has seen us move
to the Bridge club and an influx of new members the club championship proved to be fairly
elusive. Lawrence proposed various formats and eventually settled on a knockout format which
was played out early in May.

After beating Keerthi in the semi-finals, Niko overcame another hugely strong junior player
Ewan in the final as white to be crowned the Club Champion for the 2021/2022 season, a worthy
successor of Barry.

Well done Niko, we'll be coming for you next year!
