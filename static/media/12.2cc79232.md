# Happy New Year
3rd January 2022

As we mark the passing of another year, it's time for a long overdue update. Please don't be fooled
by the lack of activity on the website, as the club has been bustling with activity so far this season.

This season has seen the arrival of a number of new members which has been great to see. The club nights
are as busy as I've seen since joining the club a few years ago and members have been active both in the
internal competitions in addition to the local league.

In the league Morecambe have taken a commanding league into Christmas with 3 wins and no losses, despite
a thrilling 2 1/2 - 1 1/2 to Lancaster 'A'. Beneath them the Dragons and Lancaster 'A' both sit respectably
with 1 win and a draw ahead of Bare.

The Dragons vs Lancaster 'A' match took place at the start of the season ending in stalemate with wins for
Barry & Will for the A team offset against wins for Harry & Jonathon for the Dragons. We look forward to
the return fixture shortly.
