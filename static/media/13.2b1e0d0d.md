# Lancaster Club History
28th January 2022

Recently we were pleased to welcome a new member, Jack, who brings with 
him a part of the history of this great club. Jacks great grandfather,
Colin Waite, was a longstanding member of the club, recognised by our chairman Lawrence. See below
Jack holding two of Colin's winning certificates which Joss kindly brought in dated 1963-64 & 1988-89. 
A photo which beautifully exhibits how chess (specifically in this club!) is a game that can 
transcend generations.

Welcome Jack, and best of luck in your chess career to come!
