# Lancaster Quick-Play Tournament - September 2021
12th September 2021

On the 5th of September, a number of local chess players gathered at the Lancaster
Brewery for a quick play tournament organized by Richard Walsh.

With a turnout of 12 players from the local area (unfortunately, there were some last
minute withdrawals), the tournament was played with a Swiss system over 5 rounds. The
winners were jointly Barry Hymer & David Phillips both with 4 1/2, while a lower graded
prize was awarded to Riddhiman Ghosh and Iain Walmsley both scoring 3.

For many it proved to be a long awaited return to over the board chess which had been dearly
missed. Overall, it really was a fantastic day with everyone enjoying the chess as well
as the company.

Thanks go to the Lancaster Brewery for hosting us, it proved to be an inspired venue 
with a nice outdoor space (and tasty beer!). Thanks also have to go to Richard for taking the
initiative and providing us all with a day to remember. Finally, thanks go to Lawrence for 
running the tournament.

Below are a number of photos taken on the day.
