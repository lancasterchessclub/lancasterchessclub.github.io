# February Update
10th February 2020

The club met for its annual dinner at the Golden Dragon where a good night was enjoyed by all. Despite illness striking a few who unfortunately couldn't make it, there was a good turnout and the empty plates are a testament to the food.

The Dragons have continued their good league form with an excellent win against University 'B' thanks to wins by Danny & John and a heroic draw by Barry which I'm reliably told was quite something! With two games remaining against Kendal and University 'A', all is still to play for. Both will be incredibly tough tests however.
