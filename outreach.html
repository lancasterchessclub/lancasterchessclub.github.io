<p>James is a local schoolteacher and one of our club’s strongest
players. He runs our chess in schools programme. Every Tuesday he hosts
a half hour coaching and training session for our under 18 members. He
is also reaching out to encourage chess playing in local secondary
schools including setting up school chess clubs and arranging
competitions between youngsters.</p>
<p>Lancaster Chess Club also has links with the National Charity Chess
in Schools and Communities who provide curriculum and tutors for primary
schools. You can find more about the charity on their website <a
href="https://www.chessinschools.co.uk">www.chessinschools.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="/anto_library.jpg" /></p>
<p>Anto is a senior lecturer at Lancaster University and runs our chess
in communities programme. He hosts this every Saturday at Lancaster
Library from 10am until noon. The library has plenty of sets and boards.
So no need to bring your own. This is a free drop in service although we
also have some regulars who turn up most Saturdays. All ages are
welcome. The focus is on friendly games and Anto also provides training
for those who want it. He is one of our club’s strongest players and
sometimes gives simultaneous displays playing many opponents at the same
time.</p>
