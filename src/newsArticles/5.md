  # March Update & Season Finish
18th March 2020

Regrettably the decision was taken yesterday by Barry to suspend the remainder of the season due to government recommendation around social distancing. While this comes as a disappointment as we will miss out on a number of meets as well as the standard end of season lightning tournament, it's out of our hands. We look forward to the start of next season eagerly!

One small comfort is that the timing of this only occurred after the Dragons had the chance to finish what was a very successful season. A cracking 2 1/2-1 1/2 victory over Kendal followed by University 'A' withdrawing from the final fixture has left us placed second only on individual points to Morecambe 'A'.

The full standings can be found on the league page - https://ecflms.org.uk/lms/node/31113/tables . Below you can find a closely fought draw in the match vs Kendal.
