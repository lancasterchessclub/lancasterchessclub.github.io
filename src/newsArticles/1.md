# League Roundup
30th November 2019

The Dragons have made a rollercoaster start to the season
consisting of a disappointing 0.5-3.5 loss to Morecambe 'B', followed by
an excellent bounceback to draw Morecambe 'A' 2-2 thanks to wins by Danny
and Lawrence.

Most recently the Dragons defeated Bare Village with a score of 4-0,
where Barry, Danny, Lawrence & Jonathan all registered wins to give us
our first victory of the season.

Next up is a tough fixture versus University 'A' in one of the
the hardest matches of the year.
