# 2021/22 Season Begins
30th September 2021

The 2021/22 season kicked off on the 21st of September at the Reform club and it was great for
members to catch up with each other, in many cases having not met in person for 18 months. 

The league will now begin in earnest with both the Club Championship and Quickplay competitions, as
well as matches in the local league where we hope to field two teams this season. Updates for
these will follow.
