# Quickplay Blitz Tournament
30th January 2022

On the 25th of January, replacing our usual clubnight, Lawrence ran a 10-minute 5 round
quick play  tournament that was enjoyed by all. This was belated celebration of
our move to the premises of the Lancaster Bridge Club, which, while early days, has been a real
success. I think everyone had a fantastic evening, and I personally saw some brilliant (and at times,
highly questionable) chess. As usual, a huge thanks must go to Lawrence for running the tounament
as well as Barry for facilitating.

The joint winners were James & Danny, who fought out an incredibly tense draw to each end the event
on 4 1/2 out of 5. Incredibly, and perhaps in part due to the members not playing a huge amount of blitz,
this was the only draw of the entire event. Grading prizes went to some of the younger entrants,
Jack Eccles, Ned Griffin, Eric Thompson & Jack Wilkinson.

We look forward now to the remainder of the season, where we are keen for members to complete their
fixtures for the Club Championship.
