# Update & Perfect Chess
21st March 2021

While no doubt many of our members have continued their chess online, the club hasn't met now for a full year which is a real shame. Looking forward though, we're optimistic for the start of next season and I think I speak for everyone when I say we cannot wait to get back to the board.

In other news, this excellent music video featuring chess was recently shared with us, enjoy!
