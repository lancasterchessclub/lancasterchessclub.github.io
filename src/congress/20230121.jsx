            Players without a current grade should use any grading previously
            held from the on-line ECF database and provide reference number from
            the site – see entry section for more information. This will be
            accepted as their grading subject to approval by the organisers.
          </p>

            allocated to the runner up assuming they are graded.
          </p>
          <p>
            A player qualifying for two prizes receives only the higher of the

          <p>
            Prize money is subject to change depending on number of entrants.
