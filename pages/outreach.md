### Chess in Schools

<img width="100%" src="/congress-20230804/james.jpg" />

James is a local schoolteacher and one of our club’s strongest players. He runs our chess in schools programme. Every Tuesday he hosts a half hour coaching and training session for our under 18 members. He is also reaching out to encourage chess playing in local secondary schools including setting up school chess clubs and arranging competitions between youngsters. 

Lancaster Chess Club also has links with the National Charity Chess in Schools and Communities who provide curriculum and tutors for primary schools. You can find more about the charity on their website [www.chessinschools.co.uk](https://www.chessinschools.co.uk).


### Chess in our community

Anto is a senior lecturer at Lancaster University and runs our chess in communities programme. He hosts this every Saturday at Lancaster Library from 10am until noon. The library has plenty of sets and boards. So no need to bring your own. This is a free drop in service although we also have some regulars who turn up most Saturdays. All ages are welcome. The focus is on friendly games and Anto also provides training for those who want it. He is one of our club’s strongest players and sometimes gives simultaneous displays playing many opponents at the same time.
