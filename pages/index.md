## A Friendly Chess Club in the Heart of Lancaster

**Update: [Sunday 26th March Lancaster District Rapid Play](/congress/20230326.html)**

Based in the heart of Lancaster, UK, our historic chess club, which dates back to 1895, welcomes players of all ages and abilities to come and enjoy a game of chess. Be it for short, long, casual or competitive games there's something for everyone.

We meet weekly over the course of the year. Highlights range from the round robin club chess championship (90 minutes), to the rapid play championship, as well as occasional blitz chess tournaments. And for players who prefer to play casually, club nights always offer the opportunity to have a game.

If this sounds good, see the information for club nights below - please do get in touch via e-mail and we look forward to welcoming you soon!
