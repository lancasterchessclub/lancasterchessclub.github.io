# Blackpool Congress
18th March 2020

Four members took part in the recent Blackpool Congress - probably the last major chess event nationally for some time. Jack McQueen took part in his first tournament and performed very creditably in the Standard Section, as did Jonathan Verden. After a slow start (resigning in an arguably won position in round 1), Danny McMenamin stormed through on the Sunday to finish on 50% in a very strong Major section - a fine result.

Barry Hymer's best game in the Open was a round 1 loss to eventual tournament winner, Martin Mitchell. He missed several winning chances in this game as can be seen below (click on match in the bottom right for full annotations), and his play then got progressively weaker as the tournament progressed.
