# Farewell to Barry
11th June 2022

As previously, there has been a devoid of updates here, but the club has had an action-packed
spring full of events, and continues to move from strength to strength.

It is, however, with a heavy heart that we said goodbye to Barry Hymer as a full time member
and Secretary of the club, as he is leaving the area. This was news which came as a shock to
many of us and is no doubt a massive loss.

I'm not the correct person to assess the full impact Barry has had on the club
since he joined, having only become a member here in 2019, where he welcomed me himself. For
my part, I can say that in my time here Barry has been a huge force for good within the
club. He was always a leader through management of administrative matters in his capacity of
secretary (a role that I believe he never coveted, but rather absorbed for the good of us all!),
tournament matters as captain of the Lancaster A team, as well as being the de facto face of
the club when talking to and greeting potential new members. In the past year along with David
he played an essential role in the move to our new premises of the Bridge club, which has been
instrumental in the development of the club and leaves us in good stead.

We were delighted to award him Honorary Lifetime Membership and hope that he can drop in now
and then. Thank you Barry!
