We held our second standard play congress at Lancaster Royal Grammar
School Assembly Hall over the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 11<sup>th</sup>
August. It was a full house with 110 entrants from all over the UK. We
had sponsorship from Lancaster City Council and Cumberland Building
Society. £2,150 was distributed in prizes plus a local 12 year old chess
prodigy is receiving 6 hours of tuition from our local International
Chess Master. One of our 17 year olds won the intermediate section and
another local young man got a grading prize in the Open section. On
Saturday evening we also held an optional cash super blitz which
attracted 16 players. The whole event was ECF rated and the top two
sections were FIDE internationally rated for the first time.
