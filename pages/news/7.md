# Dick Collins vs Danny McMenamin
11th May 2020

The below text and game was supplied by Danny McMenamin. Dick forwarded me his annotations from the same exact game shortly before he passed away which have also been included. Click bottom right to expand annotations on Lichess.

The game was played between Dick Collins (White) Danny McMenamin (Black) in the semi-finals of the Individual level competition 21/1/2020. The game wasn't the best but shows good resilience and many tricks and bluffs, and blunders. Fun game with chances for both sides. Game ends in resignation by black due to over looking Dicks defensive trick.

Interesting game and the last I played against Dick, gone but won't be forgotten.
