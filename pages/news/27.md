On Sunday 18th February Lancaster Chess Club held our third rapid play congress at Cumbria University, Bowerham site. We had nearly 80 entrants from Lancashire and beyond. The congress was six rounds on a Swiss System and generously supported by Lancaster City Council. For the first time we operated in a time increment system with players getting 20 minutes each to finish their game plus 10 second increments per move. It was very successful. Particularly encouraging was the large minor section with many youngsters including some competing for the very first time at this level. The results of all the matches were posted live on chess results and you can see all of them at this link.
