## CONDITIONS OF ENTRY:
Entries received after 2 August, if accepted, will require £5 late entry fee.
Eligibility for grade-restricted sections is determined by the published ECF July grading list, or depending on date of entry. Application of this rule has allowed several players to move to a lower section. Grading prizes and pairings will be decided using the ECF July grading list.

All sections are ECF graded. The following priority is used for section allocation and seeding in the Standard Play event.

- ECF Standard Play Grade
- FIDE Standard Play Rating

Players without a current grade should use any grading previously held from the on-line ECF database and provide reference number from the site – see entry section for more information. This will be accepted as their grading subject to approval by the organisers.

Ungraded players are not eligible for a grading prize.

Ungraded players can only win up to £50 for the major, intermediate or minor events. Any unallocated prize money in either event will be allocated to the runner up assuming they are graded.

A player qualifying for two prizes receives only the higher of the two prizes.
Prize money is subject to change depending on number of entrants.

In the event of a tie for grading prize, the prize is awarded to the lowest graded player.

Swiss manager dictates the pairings in all rounds and they are not changed to suit individual preferences.

Cancellations – in the event that a player is unable to attend there will be no refund but please let the organiser know so pairings can be rearranged.
